Welcome to the Predictive Modeling project focused on analyzing and predicting digital marketing campaign performance using a Random Forest Regressor.

## Overview

This project aims to understand the correlation between creative attributes and campaign performance, providing valuable insights for designing more effective campaigns in the future.

🚀 Built during my Rocketium Interview process. This is an amazing assignment given by Rocketium team which focuses more on the Exploratory Data Analysis.

## Project Structure

- 📁 `data/`: Folder containing the dataset used for training (`Rocketium AI_ML Internship Assignment - 2 - Training dataset.csv`).
- 📁 `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook (`EDA_ROCKETIUM.ipynb`) with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and model building.
- 📁 `reports/`: Folder for project reports.
  - 📄 `Predictive_Modeling_Report.pdf`: Detailed report on the predictive modeling process.
- 📁 `src/`: Python scripts or modules (if applicable).
- 📁 `images/`: Images used in the README or project documentation.

## Instructions

### Jupyter Notebook

1. Open and run the `EDA_ROCKETIUM.ipynb` notebook to explore the Exploratory Data Analysis and predictive modeling process.
2. Review the visualizations, data preprocessing steps, and model evaluation metrics.

### Report

1. Read the detailed report in the `reports/` folder (`Predictive_Modeling_Report.pdf`) for a comprehensive overview of the project.

## How to Run

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. 

Open the notebook and execute each cell to reproduce the analysis.

## Project Findings

- Explore the correlation heatmap in `EDA_ROCKETIUM.ipynb` to understand relationships between performance metrics and creative attributes.
- Evaluate the Random Forest Regressor model's performance and its hyperparameter tuning results.

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, recommendations for future digital marketing campaigns are outlined in the report. Pay special attention to creative attributes that significantly impact campaign performance.
